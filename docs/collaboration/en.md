## Claiming Tasks

We utilize GitHub Projects for task management, so to claim a task, you first need to locate the Project corresponding to the project you wish to participate in.

Due to differences in code management strategies across various projects, there are one-to-one or many-to-one relationships between projects and repositories.

In the one-to-one relationship, the Project is within the repository, while in the many-to-one relationship, the Project is within the GitHub organization.

For easy reference, the table below organizes the containment relationship between projects and repositories, and you can access the corresponding Project by clicking on the project name:

| Project | Included Repositories (Public) |
| --- | --- |
| [OpenBuild Official Website](https://github.com/orgs/openbuildxyz/projects/9) | [openbuild-frontend](https://github.com/openbuildxyz/openbuild-frontend) |

Each Project typically includes two views: Board and Roadmap.

Generally, you only need to focus on the Board view, which is divided into 5 columns based on the status of tasks:

1. No Status - Not yet assigned;
2. Todo - Assigned to a person but not yet started;
3. In Progress - Being processed, and before entering this status, the task must have a start time and an end time set;
4. Dev Done - Development is complete and a PR has been initiated, awaiting review;
5. Closed - The PR has been reviewed and the code has been merged into the repository.

Only tasks with the status "No Status" can be claimed. Choose the ones that interest you and then:

1. Set the "Assignees" field to yourself;
2. Change the "Status" field to "Todo";
3. Set the "Start from" and "Finish at" fields to indicate the start and end times of the task.

By completing the above steps, you have claimed a task.

**Remember the start and end times you set, as this is a commitment and you should try to complete the task within this period, adhering to and fulfilling your promise.**
