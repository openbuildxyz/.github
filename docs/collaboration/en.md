## Claiming Tasks

We utilize GitHub Projects for task management, so to claim a task, you first need to locate the Project corresponding to the project you wish to participate in.

Due to differences in code management strategies across various projects, there are one-to-one or many-to-one relationships between projects and repositories.

In the one-to-one relationship, the Project is within the repository, while in the many-to-one relationship, the Project is within the GitHub organization.

For easy reference, the table below organizes the containment relationship between projects and repositories, and you can access the corresponding Project by clicking on the project name:

| Project | Included Repositories (Public) |
| --- | --- |
| [OpenBuild Official Website](https://github.com/orgs/openbuildxyz/projects/9) | [openbuild-frontend](https://github.com/openbuildxyz/openbuild-frontend) |

Each Project typically includes the following views:

- Claimable – the pool of tasks that can be claimed, those without an "Assignees" field set;
- Board – tasks that have entered the processing flow, displayed in columns according to their status;
- Schedule – to view the scheduling of all tasks that have entered the processing flow;
- Mine – to view tasks that have been assigned to yourself.

Select from the "Claimable" view the ones that interest you, and then:

1. Set the "Assignees" field to yourself;
2. Set the "Start from" and "Finish at" fields to indicate the start and end times of the task.

By completing the above steps, you have claimed a task.

**Remember the start and end times you set, as this is a commitment and you should try to complete the task within this period, adhering to and fulfilling your promise.**

When you start working on the task, change the status field to "In Progress"; when the task is completed, change the status field to "Done" and associate it with the corresponding PR for review.
